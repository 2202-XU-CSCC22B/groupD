## Project Description
Our project aims to develop a Gym Management System for Unscathed Fitness Gym in Cagayan de Oro. The system will automate their gym operations, from tracking memberships, managing sales, and monitoring employee salaries and expenses. The gym management system will also include a landing page for their online presence, providing a convenient and accessible way for gym members to interact with the gym and its services.

## Technology Used
- Front-end: NextJS
- Back-end: Spring Boot

### Why NextJS?
We chose NextJS as our front-end framework because of its numerous advantages. NextJS is built on top of React and provides server-side rendering (SSR), which enhances performance and improves the initial loading time of the web application. Additionally, NextJS offers excellent support for search engine optimization (SEO) and provides a seamless developer experience with features like hot module replacement and automatic code splitting. Its extensive ecosystem and active community make it an ideal choice for building modern and scalable web applications.

### Why Spring Boot?
For the back-end development of our Gym Management System, we opted for Spring Boot. Spring Boot is a robust Java-based framework that simplifies the development of enterprise-grade applications. It provides essential features such as dependency injection, auto-configuration, and a wide range of libraries and modules, making it highly efficient and productive for building RESTful APIs. Spring Boot's emphasis on convention over configuration enables rapid development, and its strong ecosystem and community support ensure the availability of extensive resources and documentation. With Spring Boot, we can create a secure, scalable, and maintainable back-end system for our Gym Management System.

- Honestly , nalimtan lang gyud namu ug butang sir. Sorry âœŒ 
- Medyo hasol man gud kaayo mag update ug changes sa akong deployment kay beginners pa.
- This made us realize why Docker is important. Mag study nmi ani next time.
- Thank you sir!!!
